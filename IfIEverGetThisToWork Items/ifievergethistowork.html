<p>The cheeseburger combo comes with a cheeseburger (DUH!), fries and a drink. The burgers come with lettuce, tomatoes onions and pickles. If you don't want it on there, take it off yourself. We supply you with packets of mustard, mayo and ketchup. A "do it yourself" burger kit. Please DO NOT make us overextend ourselves trying to serve you. </p><br><img src="cheeseburgercombo.jpg" id = "photosAll" alt="Cheeseburger">

<div id ="item4"><b>Hamburger Combo</b>
    <span>$8</span>
<p>Big surprise! This combo is the same as the cheeseburger combo but without cheese. Do not try to make a joke out of ordering a hamburger combo and requesting cheese on it. We have heard it all before. It wasn't funny then and it will not be funny now.</p>
