<!-- the big salad button needs to be where it can multiply the number of salads ordered by $10 and that total needs to be added to the cart. This should update the main cart. The remove button needs to be connected to remove individual items from the cart and update the cart total after an item is removed. Should it be where an item quantity can be changed? Yes it should but I may not be able to do this. Goal is to get this working and then move on to another item. Divide and concur! -->
